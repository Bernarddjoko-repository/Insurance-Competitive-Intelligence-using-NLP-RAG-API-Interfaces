      "The causes of the largest amount of losses across all carriers are the result of inherent unpredictability and complexity in predicting and managing the factors that lead to property and casualty claims. Some of these specific carriers may most be impacted by severe weather and other catastrophe events, including hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, and fires. Additionally, climate change may also be exacerbating these events and their impacts. \n",
      "\n",
      "These events are inherently unpredictable and can change in frequency, severity, duration, geographic location, and scope. They can have a significant impact on the profitability of our property and other businesses more than they affect the profitability of our other businesses. The extent of insured losses from a catastrophe event is a function of our total insured exposure in the area affected by the event, the nature, severity, and duration of the event, and the extent of reinsurance that we have obtained with respect to such an event. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that the specific factors and trends that drive losses can change over time, and these changes may be influenced by or affected by both internal and external events. The impact of these factors can vary across different types of insurance carriers and regions due to the unique composition of risks in each carrier's or regional portfolio.\n"
